# AdGuard DNS Filter for Personal Use

This is a personal AdGuard DNS filter list, mainly created for learning and experimentation.
I'm still learning GitHub and filter creation, so things might not be perfect ‚Äî thanks for your understanding!

## üìå Important Notes

- This filter is intended for testing and personal use only.
- I do not guarantee its effectiveness in blocking ads, trackers, or harmful content.
- Use at your own risk ‚Äî I'm not responsible if anything breaks or goes wrong.

---

## üîß Filter Creation Process

- The filter list is first generated using the [AdGuardTeam/HostlistCompiler](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler).
- Then, shell scripts are used to clean and customize the filter list.
- You can view the original unprocessed filter list [here](https://monsivamon.github.io/AdGuard_DNS_Filter_for_myself/Filters/generated_org.txt).
- These customizations include filtering out non-existent domains by checking them with [massdns](https://github.com/blechschmidt/massdns).
- Please note that these modifications are unofficial and might reduce the effectiveness of the original filter[AdGuardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardSDNSFilter).

## üîó How to Use This Filter

To use this filter in AdGuard (AdGuard Home, AdGuard DNS, etc.), add the following URL to your custom DNS filter list:

https://monsivamon.github.io/AdGuard_DNS_Filter_for_myself/Filters/main_filter.txt

To use this filter in AdAway, add the following URL to your custom host filter list:

https://monsivamon.github.io/AdGuard_DNS_Filter_for_myself/Filters/converted_for_adaway.txt

‚ö†Ô∏è To reduce false positives, this version is less aggressive than the AdGuard DNS version and may have lower blocking accuracy.

## üîÑ Update Policy

- This filter is automatically updated every 8 hours using GitHub Actions.
- Each update pulls the latest source rules, verifies domains using massdns, and rebuilds the list.
- Manual edits or updates may also be made at any time during testing or maintenance.
